Introduction..

## Science Question(s)
Does normalizing by the boundary layer depth before calculating higher-order moments give more accurate results?
## Project Scope (what does success look like)?
Showing one method is better by a quantifiable metric.
## Hypothesis (or Hypotheses)
The normalized method will be more accurate.
